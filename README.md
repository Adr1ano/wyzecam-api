# Wyzecam API (unofficial, reverse engineered for experimental use only).

Wyzecams are awesome. At 19$, these are the perfect Wi-Fi cameras. They are reliable, well built and the Wyzecam mobile app is well made. But, the application lack a feature I really need: a way to access the cameras feed outside the mobile application. This repository is my attempt to document the Wyzecam API protocol to locally get my cameras feed in a cross-platform desktop application.

Feel free to participate, issue pull requests, etc.
